<p class="lead" markdown=1>All about Minchin.ca</p>

This started in April 2006 as a blog with Blogger and a site of
GooglePages, moved to a new domain in July 2007 and went online for the
first time that September. The website is now on its third redesign.

**Minchin.ca** is a place for me to try out my skill with web
technologies and to have my own little (virtual) space.

* * * * *

There are a number of sections to this website. In brief:

-   **Home** --
    [Minchin.ca/](http://minchin.ca/) --
    Probably the first page you came across. It looks cool and links to
    a number of other pages on my site.
-   **Blog** -- [Blog.Minchin.ca](http://blog.minchin.ca/) -- My summary
    of some of the random, different, and more intersting things I find
    of the web, and even in the "real" world. Orginally hosted at
    minchinweb.blogspot.com (all link are redirected to the new
    location), it's still powered by [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com).
-   **Geneology** --
    [Minchin.ca/Genealogy/](http://minchin.ca/genealogy) --
    When I started into geneology a few years back, one of the first
    things I did was check out Minchin domain names on the web. I found
    [Minchin.net](http://minchin.net), a site for music equipment
    somewhere on the eastern seaboard in the States. We're related, but
    if I remember right, it's rather distant. If you think we might be
    related, [drop me a note](http://minchin.ca/contact.htm) and
    fill me in on the details.
-   **Projects** -- [Minchin.ca/Projects/](http://minchin.ca/projects/) -- 
	Over the years, I’ve worked on a number of projects, both online and off.
	This is meant to link to some of the more exciting ones, particularly
	those found online. Includes Highway Planning, Web Design, Programming,
	Articles, Photography, and Videos.
-   **Search** -- [Minchin.ca/Search/](http://minchin.ca/search/) -- 
    It will allow you to use [Google](http://www.google.com) to search both
    this site and the internet. The ad revenue from here is what funds
    most of this site.
-   **About** --
    [Minchin.ca/About/](http://minchin.ca/about/) -- This
    page! The idea is to tell you what the different sections of the
    website are about.
-   **Contact Me** --
    [Minchin.ca/Contact/](http://minchin.ca/contact/) -- If
    you want to get a hold of me, this page will give you the details.
