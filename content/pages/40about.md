<p class="lead" markdown=1>All about Minchin.ca</p>

This started in April 2006 as a blog with Blogger and a site of
GooglePages, moved to a new domain in July 2007 and went online for the
first time that September. The website is now on its third redesign.

**Minchin.ca** is a place for me to try out my skill with web
technologies and to have my own little (virtual) space.

* * * * *

There are a number of sections to this website. In brief:

<div class="real-list" markdown=1>
- **Home** -- [Minchin.ca/](http://minchin.ca/) -- Probably the first page you
  came across. It looks cool and links to a number of other pages on my site.
- **Blog** -- [Blog.Minchin.ca](http://blog.minchin.ca/) -- My summary of some
  of the random, different, and more intersting things I find of the web, and
  even in the "real" world. Orginally hosted at minchinweb.blogspot.com (all
  link are redirected to the new location), it's now powered by
  [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican), like the rest of the site.
- **Geneology** -- [Minchin.ca/Genealogy/](http://minchin.ca/genealogy) -- When
  I started into geneology a few years back, one of the first things I did was
  check out Minchin domain names on the web. I found
  [Minchin.net](http://minchin.net), a site for music equipment somewhere on
  the eastern seaboard in the States. We're related, but if I remember right,
  it's rather distant. If you think we might be related,
  [drop me a note](http://minchin.ca/contact.htm) and fill me in on the details.
- **Projects** -- [Minchin.ca/Projects/](http://minchin.ca/projects/) -- 
  Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on a number of projects, both online and off.
  This is meant to link to some of the more exciting ones, particularly those
  found online. Includes Highway Planning, Web Design, Programming, Articles,
  Photography, and Videos.
- **Search** -- [Minchin.ca/Search/](http://minchin.ca/search/) --  It will
  allow you to use [Google](http://www.google.com) to search both this site and
  the internet. The ad revenue from here is what funds most of this site.
- **About** -- [Minchin.ca/About/](http://minchin.ca/about/) -- This page! The
  idea is to tell you what the different sections of the website are about.
- **Contact Me** -- [Minchin.ca/Contact/](http://minchin.ca/contact/) -- If you
  want to get a hold of me, this page will give you the details.
