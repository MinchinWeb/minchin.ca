Lots of the Stuff I've Done.

Over the years, I've worked on a number of projects, both online &
off. This is meant to link to some of the more exciting ones,
particularly those found online.

Highway Planning
----------------

My highway and transportation projects have largely consisted of *Functional
Planning Studies* (FPS) and *Traffic Impact Analyses*. A *Functional Planning
Study* will look at a section of highway and image how it might be used into
the future. A common time horizon for these studies is 50 years out. A
*Traffic Impact Analysis* is usually smaller in both geography and time, many
times looking at an intersection 5 to 20 years into the future. A TIA will
often be done to determine what road system improvements should be made as a
result of a adjacent, proposed land development project.

My highway planning is all done offline, but I'll provide links where I
can.

Web Design
----------

I have maintained my own personal website since 2007, and have done some web
design for others as well.

<div class="real-list" markdown=1>
-   **[Minchin.ca](http://www.Minchin.ca/index.html) -- Bootstrap Edition** --
    2014-present -- in the 7 years since I originally designed the site,
    one of the
	biggest changes is that so much of the web in now accessed through smart
	phones. So this redesign was in large part abour making the site look good
	on my phone. The theme has now been repackaged as
    [Seafoam](https://github.com/minchinweb/seafoam), a standalone theme for
    Pelican, a static site generator written in Python and what is used to
    generate this site.
-   **[Metro Financial Planning](design/www.metrofinancialplanning.com/index.html)** --
    2011-12 -- A professional project. This is a wordpress driven site
    for a local financial planner. I set up the site and maintain it,
    and set up his email.
-   **Matthew Bissett for PC MLA -- Sherwood
    Park** -- 2011 -- A wordpress driven site
    for a friend running for nomination for the PC party in his riding.
    I set up the site and he provided the photos and copy.
-   **Minchin.ca -- Kwick Edition** --
    2010 -- This just went live for the main page of
    [Minchin.ca](design/www.minchin.ca/kwick.htm). I realize that it may not be
    obvious where the links are or what they do at first glance, but I
    love the effect.
-   **Minchin.ca -- Rounders Edition** -- 2007 -- This version of
    [Minchin.ca](design/www.minchin.ca/about.htm) was the first to go live. It was
    based on the Blogger template I was using at the time, but includes
    a picture I took in Hawaii as the header background.

Programming
-----------

Programming is something I have enjoyed for many years. Between 2010 and 2013, by focus was largely on writing AI's for OpenTTD (see WmDOT below). Since 2013, my focus has been solving problems of personal interest using Python. Some of my projects are listed below.

I also maintain a profile at [GitHub](https://github.com/MinchinWeb) and post
the code there for most of these projects and several others as well.

<div class="real-list" markdown=1>
-   **Colourettu** -- 2014-present -- An open-source Python library.
    Colourettu is a small collection of colour functions that can be used to
    determine the (relative) luminosity of a colour and the contrast between
    two colours. There is also the palette class for dealing with a 'list' of
    colours. In addition to the code, it has been packaged (and is available
    on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colourettu)),
    [documentation](http://minchin.ca/colourettu/) is online, and
    [automated testing](https://travis-ci.org/MinchinWeb/colourettu)
    (continuous integration) is in place.
-   **topydo** -- 2015-present -- A powerful todo list application for the
    console, written in Python. I provided several Pull Requests, including to
    provide colour support on Windows CMD (see
    [PR49](https://github.com/bram85/topydo/pull/49)), code style improvements
    to bring the code base in better compliance with [PEP8](http://pep8.org/)
    (see [PR55](https://github.com/bram85/topydo/pull/55)), remove platform
    specific hacks to creating temporary files (see
    [commit](https://github.com/bram85/topydo/commit/0e5977729c2fe357fb8689c79c4d8a09eba699ff)),
    added the ability to print a "screen-ful" of top todo items (see
    [PR118](https://github.com/bram85/topydo/pull/118)), and added a filter to
    selectively hide todo items (see
    [PR131](https://github.com/bram85/topydo/pull/131)).
-   **green** -- 2016 -- A clean, colorful, fast Python test runner. I
    provided a [Pull Request](https://github.com/CleanCut/green/pull/120) to
    resolve issues when outputting colour to Windows CMD.
-   **release** -- 2016 -- A powerful Sphinx changelog-generating extension.
    (Sphinx in a documentation generator for Python source code.) I
    provided a [Pull Request](https://github.com/bitprophet/releases/pull/61)
    to allow specifing multiple changelog files, and another
    [Pull Request](https://github.com/bitprophet/releases/pull/60) to supply
    the version number to Sphinx.
-   **jrnl** -- 2013-2015 -- A simple command line journal application that
    stores your journal in a plain text file, written in Python. I provided
    Pull Requests to add an 'export to Pelican' feature (see
    [PR347](https://github.com/maebert/jrnl/pull/347)), expanding
    documentation (see [PR124](https://github.com/maebert/jrnl/pull/124)), and
    to fix numerous bugs (see
    [PR110](https://github.com/maebert/jrnl/pull/110),
    [PR349](https://github.com/maebert/jrnl/pull/349),
    [PR397](https://github.com/maebert/jrnl/pull/397), and
    [PR416](https://github.com/maebert/jrnl/pull/416)).

<div class="real-list" markdown=1>
-   **WmDOT** -- 2010-14 -- An AI for [OpenTTD](http://www.openttd.org),
    an open source remake of Transport Tycoon Deluxe. My AI is written
    in Squirrel (somewhat similar to C++) and serves to build out the
    road network for you.
    ([code](https://github.com/MinchinWeb/openttd-wmdot); [release
    thread](http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=53698)).

-   **MinchinWeb's MetaLibrary** (MWML) -- 2010-15 -- A library for
    programming AIs for OpenTTD that started as an offshoot of WmDOT.
    ([code](https://github.com/MinchinWeb/openttd-metalibrary);
    [documentation](http://minchin.ca/openttd-metalibrary/); [release
    thread](http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=57903)).
    As of Feb. 2017, this has been downloaded over 599,000 times!
-   **MTS** (Minchin Timesheet System) -- 2010 -- Written in VBA in Excel,
    this is designed to keep track of your time spent on various
    projects. I've made use of it myself when working on professional
    web design projects. ([release
    post](http://blog.minchin.ca/2010/07/minchin-timesheet-system-version-11.html);
    [direct download](../MTS_1v1.xlsm))
-   **Transportation Research Board (TRB) Bibliography style** for
    Microsoft Word -- 2010 -- I did this while working on my Master's
    thesis. It is an XML files that creates a new bibliography style for
    use in Word. ([release

    Maker. ([blog post
