Lots of the Stuff I've Done

particularly those found online.

Web Design
----------

-   **[Minchin.ca](http://www.Minchin.ca/index.htm) -- Bootstrap Edition** --
    2014 -- in the 7 years since I originally designed the site, one of the
	biggest changes is that so much of the web in now accessed through smart
	phones. So this redesign was in large part abour making the site look good
	on my phone.
-   **[Metro Financial Planning](../design/www.metrofinancialplanning.com/)** --
    2011-12 -- A professional project. This is a wordpress driven site
    for a local financial planner. I set up the site and maintain it,
    and set up his email.
-   **Matthew Bissett for PC MLA -- Sherwood
    Park** -- 2011 -- A wordpress driven site
    for a friend running for nomination for the PC party in his riding.
    I set up the site and he provided the photos and copy.
-   **Minchin.ca -- Kwick Edition** --
    2010 -- This just went live for the main page of
    [Minchin.ca](../design/www.minchin.ca/kwick.htm). I realize that it may not be
    obvious where the links are or what they do at first glance, but I
    love the effect.
-   **Minchin.ca -- Rounders Edition** -- 2007 -- This version of
    [Minchin.ca](../design/www.minchin.ca/about.htm) was the first to go live. It was
    based on the Blogger template I was using at the time, but includes
    a picture I took in Hawaii as the header background.
