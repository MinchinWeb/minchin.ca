  <p>I got into Genealogy a few years back, and started by putting a few of the books we had laying around from family reunions. The downside is I have several thousand people in my database, but many of them are living cousins rather than my ancestors. I still have several ancestors recorded however, up to 15 generations back. Both sides of my family go back to Ireland (with Minchins settling in Prince Edward Island in the 1860's), and from there, one of them disappears (we're missing a couple of generations) and then appears to go back to a baron who came across from Normandy with William the Conqueror; the other continues back to England and to William of Woodvale.</p>

<h2>Fun bits of History</h2>
  <h3>The Boer War (South Africa)</h3>
    <p>During the siege of Mafeking, Robert Banden-Powell (who later founded Scouting) established his offices about those of a lawyer by the name of Minchin. Apparently you can take tours of the office today.</p>
  <h3>Minchinbury Estates</h3>
    <p>An officer in the British army by the name of Minchin was given an estate in New South Wales, Australia. He was a contemporary of Captain Bligh, and opposed some of Bligh's politics. A few years later, his entire family was lost at sea. The estate was sold, and eventaully developed into a winery. Minchinbury champagne is considered quite excellent. In recent years, the winery closed and the area was redeveloped as housing. A fighter jet on a pedestal now sits at the entrance.
  <h3>Minchin Mason Lodge</h3>
    <p>There is a Mason Lodge in India, founded by a Minchin.</p>
  <h3>Minchinhapton, England</h3>
    <p>An former market town in England. I'm told that the last Minchin living there died about 15 years ago.</p>
  <h3>Minchin, Texas</h3>
    <p>It seems close enough to Dallas/Fort Worth to be a suburb.</p>
  <h3>Minchin Lake, New Zealand</h3>
    <p>Named after a runholder who worked the area.</p>
  <h3>Minchin</h3>
    <p>A geological formation in South America.</p>
  <h3>Tim Minchin</h3>
    <p>A comedian.</p>
  <h3>Nick Minchin</h3>
    <P>An Australian politician. He is currently serving as the Minister of Finance.</p>
  <hr />
  <h3>Bunbury, Prince Edward Island</h3>
    <p>I'd need to find it on a map again, but I think it exists...</p>
  <h3>Bunbury, Australia</h3>
    <p>The Bunburys were active in the British military, and they got a city of Australia's west coast named after them. The city is not far from Perth.</p>
  <h3>Bunbury Road, Valmont, BC, Canada</h3>
  <h3>Bunbury Castles, Ireland</h3>
    <p>Twin castles built in Tipperary county, Ireland, not far from the Balarny stone, for a set of Bunbury brothers in the 18th or 19th century.</p>
