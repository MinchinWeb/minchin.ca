A <em>Functional Planning Study</em> will look at a section of highway and image how it might be used into the future. A common time horizon for these studies is 50 years out. A <em>Traffic Impact Analysis</em> is usually smaller in both geography and time, many times looking at an intersection 5 to 20 years into the future. A <span class=caps>TIA</span> will often be done to determine what road system improvements should be made as a result of a adjacent, proposed land development&nbsp;project.</p> <p>My highway planning is all done offline, but I&#8217;ll provide links where I&nbsp;can.</p> <div class="center-block thumbnail max-col-md-9"> <img src=../images/morinville-roundabout-688.jpg> <caption>Proposed Roundabout on Highway 642 in Morinville</caption> </div> <div class=real-list> <ul> <li><strong>Highway 642 Functional Planning Study</strong> &#8212;

So this redesign was in large part abour making the site look good on my phone. The theme has now been repackaged as <a href=https://github.com/minchinweb/seafoam>Seafoam</a>, a standalone theme for Pelican, a static site generator written in Python and what is used to generate this&nbsp;site.</li> <li><strong><a href=design/www.metrofinancialplanning.com/index.html>Metro Financial Planning</a></strong> &#8212; 2011-12 &#8212; A professional project.

Between 2010 and 2013, by focus was largely on writing <span class=caps>AI</span>&#8217;s for OpenTTD (see WmDOT below). Since 2013, my focus has been solving problems of personal interest using Python. Some of my projects are listed&nbsp;below.</p> <p>I also maintain a profile at <a href=https://github.com/MinchinWeb>GitHub</a> and post the code there for most of these projects and several others as&nbsp;well.</p> <div class=real-list> <ul> <li><strong>Colourettu</strong> &#8212; 2014-present &#8212; An open-source Python library. Colourettu is a small collection of colour functions that can be used to determine the (relative) luminosity of a colour and the contrast between two colours. There is also the palette class for dealing with a &#8216;list&#8217; of colours. In addition to the code, it has been packaged (and is available on <a href=https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colourettu>PyPI</a>), <a href=http://minchin.ca/colourettu/ >documentation</a> is online, and <a href=https://travis-ci.org/MinchinWeb/colourettu>automated testing</a> (continuous integration) is in&nbsp;place.</li> <li><strong>topydo</strong> &#8212; 2015-present &#8212; A powerful todo list application for the console, written in Python. I provided several Pull Requests, including to provide colour support on Windows <span class=caps>CMD</span> (see <a href=https://github.com/bram85/topydo/pull/49><span class=caps>PR49</span></a>), code style improvements to bring the code base in better compliance with <a href=http://pep8.org/ ><span class=caps>PEP8</span></a> (see <a href=https://github.com/bram85/topydo/pull/55><span class=caps>PR55</span></a>), remove platform specific hacks to creating temporary files (see <a href=https://github.com/bram85/topydo/commit/0e5977729c2fe357fb8689c79c4d8a09eba699ff>commit</a>), added the ability to print a &#8220;screen-ful&#8221; of top todo items (see <a href=https://github.com/bram85/topydo/pull/118><span class=caps>PR118</span></a>), and added a filter to selectively hide todo items (see <a href=https://github.com/bram85/topydo/pull/131><span class=caps>PR131</span></a>).</li> <li><strong>green</strong> &#8212; 2016 &#8212; A clean, colorful, fast Python test runner.

(Sphinx in a documentation generator for Python source code.) I provided a <a href=https://github.com/bitprophet/releases/pull/61>Pull Request</a> to allow specifing multiple changelog files, and another <a href=https://github.com/bitprophet/releases/pull/60>Pull Request</a> to supply the version number to&nbsp;Sphinx.</li> <li><strong>jrnl</strong> &#8212; 2013-2015 &#8212; A simple command line journal application that stores your journal in a plain text file, written in Python. I provided Pull Requests to add an &#8216;export to Pelican&#8217; feature (see <a href=https://github.com/maebert/jrnl/pull/347><span class=caps>PR347</span></a>), expanding documentation (see <a href=https://github.com/maebert/jrnl/pull/124><span class=caps>PR124</span></a>), and to fix numerous bugs (see <a href=https://github.com/maebert/jrnl/pull/110><span class=caps>PR110</span></a>, <a href=https://github.com/maebert/jrnl/pull/349><span class=caps>PR349</span></a>, <a href=https://github.com/maebert/jrnl/pull/397><span class=caps>PR397</span></a>, and <a href=https://github.com/maebert/jrnl/pull/416><span class=caps>PR416</span></a>).</li> </ul> </div> <div class="center-block thumbnail max-col-md-9"> <img src=../images/wmdot-twinned-freeways-688.png> <caption>WmDOT in action</caption> </div> <div class=real-list> <ul> <li><strong>WmDOT</strong> &#8212; 2010-14 &#8212; An <span class=caps>AI</span> for <a href=http://www.openttd.org>OpenTTD</a>, an open source remake of Transport Tycoon Deluxe.
